# Conviction Timer App

This is an Android application designed to serve as a specialized timer for Conviction Training.

## Features

- **Customizable Repetition Timer:** Configurable timing for each phase of a repetition:
    - 2 seconds for the eccentric (bottom position) phase.
    - 1 second hold at the bottom position.
    - 2 seconds for the concentric (top position) phase.
    - 1 second pause before the next repetition.
- **Repetition Counter:** Counts repetitions in English (e.g., "one", "two", "three") upon reaching the top position.
- **Configurable Total Reps:** Users can input the desired total number of repetitions via increment/decrement buttons.
- **Accurate Timer:** Implemented with a focus on precise timing to minimize drift.

## Technology Stack

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose** for UI development
- **Android** platform

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and run the app:

### 1. Open Project in Android Studio

1.  Launch Android Studio.
2.  Select "Open an Existing Project" (or "Open").
3.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`/Users/matsudo840/develop/conviction-timer-app`) and click "Open".
4.  Allow Android Studio to perform a Gradle Sync. This may take a few minutes.

### 2. Configure Gradle Properties

Ensure your `gradle.properties` file (located in the project root) contains the following lines to enable AndroidX and Jetifier, which are required for this project:

```properties
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

### 3. Set Minimum SDK Version

The project requires a minimum SDK version of 26 due to the use of adaptive icons. This is configured in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
minSdk = 26
```

### 4. Prepare Beep Sound (Optional)

For the optional "beep" sound functionality (currently disabled in code), you will need to place a short `.ogg` audio file named `beep.ogg` in the following directory:

`app/src/main/res/raw/beep.ogg`

If the `raw` directory does not exist, create it.

### 5. Create an Android Emulator or Connect a Device

1.  In Android Studio, go to `Tools > AVD Manager` to create a new virtual device (emulator).
2.  Alternatively, connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled.

### 6. Run the Application

1.  Select your desired emulator or connected device from the device dropdown in the Android Studio toolbar.
2.  Click the green "Run 'app'" button (â–¶) to build and deploy the application.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound from Text-to-Speech (TTS)

If you don't hear the repetition announcements:

1.  **Check Device Volume:** Ensure your emulator or physical device's media volume is turned up.
2.  **Check TTS Engine Settings:**
    *   On your Android device, go to `Settings > System > Languages & input > Text-to-speech output`.
    *   Verify that "Google Text-to-speech Engine" is selected as the preferred engine.
    *   Tap the settings icon next to the engine and ensure that the English (US) voice data is installed.
3.  **Check Logcat:** In Android Studio's Logcat window, filter by tag `TTS`. Look for messages like `Speaking repetition: X` to confirm the app is attempting to play sound. If you see `TTS Initialization failed.` or language-related errors, address those first.

### Build Errors

*   **`Unresolved reference: KeyboardOptions` or `KeyboardType`**: Ensure `MainActivity.kt` has the following imports:
    ```kotlin
    import androidx.compose.foundation.text.KeyboardOptions
    import androidx.compose.ui.text.input.KeyboardType
    ```
*   **`Unresolved reference: raw`**: This typically means the `beep.ogg` file is missing or incorrectly named in `app/src/main/res/raw/`. Even if the beep sound is disabled in code, the reference might still cause issues if the file is expected by the build system. Clean and rebuild your project (`Build > Clean Project`, then `Build > Rebuild Project`).
