# Conviction Timer App

## What is this?

This is a simple timer application designed to support bodyweight exercises, especially those that require slow and controlled movements (like "Conviction Training"). It's perfect for anyone who wants to maintain a precise pace during their workout.

## Key Features

- **Guided Timer with Audio Cues**
    - The app provides clear audio cues for each phase of an exercise (lowering, holding, and raising your body).
    - It helps you maintain a consistent rhythm: "Down (2 seconds) → Hold (1 second) → Up (2 seconds) → Rest (1 second)."

- **Repetition Counter**
    - The app counts your reps aloud in English ("One," "Two," "Three," etc.), so you can focus on your form without losing track.

- **Simple Repetition Setup**
    - Easily set your target number of reps for the day with simple buttons.

## How to Use

1.  Open the app and set the total number of repetitions you want to perform.
2.  Press the "START" button to begin the timer.
3.  Just follow the audio guide to perform your exercises.
