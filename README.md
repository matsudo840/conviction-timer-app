# Conviction Timer App

## What is this?

This is a simple timer application designed to support bodyweight exercises, especially those that require slow and controlled movements (like "Conviction Training"). It's perfect for anyone who wants to maintain a precise pace during their workout.

## Key Features

- **Guided Timer with Audio Cues**
    - The app provides clear audio cues for each phase of an exercise, helping you maintain a consistent 6-second rhythm per repetition.
    - A distinct sound marks the start and end of each movement phase (e.g., lowering, holding, raising), while a separate sound indicates the transitions.

- **Repetition Counter**
    - The app counts your reps aloud in English ("One," "Two," "Three," etc.), so you can focus on your form without losing track.

- **Simple Repetition Setup**
    - Easily set your target number of reps for the day with intuitive buttons.

## How to Use

1.  Open the app and use the `+` and `-` buttons to set the total number of repetitions you want to perform.
2.  Press the **START** button to begin the timer.
3.  Follow the audio guide to perform your exercises.
4.  Use the **PAUSE** button to temporarily stop the timer if needed.
5.  Press the **RESET** button to clear the current workout and set a new number of reps.
